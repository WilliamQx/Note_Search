from NoteBookSearch.NoteBookSearch import test
from NoteBookSearch.DataManager import DataRead

This is to provide convenience to the users,  this will allow
them to import directly from NoteBookSearch,
"from NoteBookSearch import DataManager", now they don't need to have the .DataManager
as above.
